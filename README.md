# Store Data Analysis using Excel

This project focuses on a comprehensive data analysis of Freshco Hypermarket’s operations. The analysis covers multiple aspects of the business, including order and delivery trends, customer behavior, product ratings, and delivery performance. The goal is to derive insights that can help optimize Freshco's logistics, marketing strategies, and customer satisfaction.

## Order Level Analysis 

-Top 10 Delivery Areas: Identified the top delivery regions, such as Bellandur Green Glen and Bommanahalli, highlighting these as key areas for focusing delivery logistics and marketing efforts. 
-Time Slot Insights: Analysis showed that the afternoon slot had the highest number of orders, suggesting a peak in activity during this period, possibly due to midday shopping habits. 
-Monthly Discounts: There was a noticeable increase in average discounts from January to September, likely indicating strategic promotional efforts to boost sales as the year progressed. 

## Completion Rate Analysis 
-Completion by Source: Sources such as Organic and Snapchat had the highest completion rates, with nearly 99.5% of orders completed successfully. -Acquisition by Month: Customer acquisition was highest in January and saw a gradual decline through September. -Customer Lifetime Value (LTV): Customers from organic sources had the highest LTV, indicating they bring the most long-term value to the business. 
-Average Revenue by Source: Snapchat emerged as the source with the highest average revenue per customer, while Instagram had the lowest. 

## Customer Satisfaction and Rating Analysis 
-Slot-wise Ratings: The afternoon and late-night slots had the highest customer satisfaction ratings, with the morning slot showing slightly lower scores. 
-Product Ratings: Products were generally rated highly, with most products scoring between 4.7 and 5 on a scale of 5.

## Delivery Analysis 
-Weekdays vs. Weekends: Delivery times were consistently faster on weekdays than weekends, indicating a smoother operation during the week. 
-Slot-wise Delivery Charges: The analysis showed that late-night deliveries incurred the highest charges, while morning deliveries were the least expensive, reflecting higher operational costs for late-night slots. 

## Summary and Recommendations 
-Resource Allocation: Afternoon orders peaked, so additional resources should be allocated to manage the high volume during these hours. Promotions could also be focused on off-peak hours to balance demand. 
-Optimizing Delivery Times: Delivery routing and scheduling should be analyzed further to optimize performance in regions with consistently longer delivery times. 
-Customer Acquisition Strategies: Organic and Snapchat sources provided the highest returns, so future marketing strategies should emphasize these channels to increase both completion rates and lifetime customer value. 
-Promotional Effectiveness: The steady increase in discount usage suggests that targeted promotions can drive more sales, especially during off-peak times like the night slot.

This analysis provided valuable insights into Freshco Hypermarket’s business operations and customer behavior. The recommendations can be used to improve efficiency in logistics, enhance customer satisfaction, and boost overall sales and profitability.
